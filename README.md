# Highlights of my Projects


## Google Course Calendar

I attended a 6-month IBM Artificial Intelligence course.  We were given the class schedule in a PDF.  It was a hassle to refer to it. So, I took the initiative to create a Google Calendar for the class to **notify** them when classes began and provided them the **unique link** to register their attendances.

## IBM Artificial Intelligence (Data Science) Capstone Project

My Data Science Capstone Project was a machine model to predict **Employee Attrition**.  I wrote 2 Python programs. One to clean the data, the other to call the ML model I'd hosted on Azure via APIs. Below are some plots. [Link to code](https://github.com/CharlieBlogg/Present/tree/main/IBM%20AI%20Course%20-%20Codes)

## Course Google Calendar

Here's a highlight of my personal project.  I attended a 6-month IBM Artificial Intelligence course.  We were given the class schedule in a PDF.  It was a hassle for all of us to refer to it.  The class falls on different dates each week and we need to register our attendance via Singpass. So, I took the initiative to create a Google Calendar which **notified** my coursemates when the class begins and provided them the **unique link** to register their attendance.
